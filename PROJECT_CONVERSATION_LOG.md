## MSCA Organization Details

**User:** "These are the details

Maharashtra Sports Climbing Association (MSCA) 

The tagline of the Maharashtra Sport Climbing 
Association is 
"United by Climbing ‚Äì ‡§Ü‡§∞‡•ã‡§π‡§£‡•á‡§® ‡§è‡§ï‡§ï‡•É‡§§"


Associations:  

Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation

Indian Mountaineering Foundation

At the Maharashtra Sport Climbing Association, PCMC Climbing Wall, this spirit of 
unity is at the heart of everything we do. We are building more than athletes‚Äîwe are 
building a community that climbs higher together.



About Us 
Background of Maharashtra Sport Climbing 
Association (MSCA) 
The Maharashtra Sport Climbing Association (MSCA) was established 
in 2025 with a mission to promote Sport Climbing across the state, in collaboration 
with infrastructural support from the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation 
(PCMC). This visionary initiative is the brainchild of Mr. Surendra Shelke, an avid 
mountaineer and sport climber, and Mr. Sagar Palkar, an Everester and passionate 
advocate for adventure and sports among the youth. Mr. Shrikrishna Kaduskar has 
played a pivotal role in translating this vision into action on the ground, making 
significant strides in taking sport climbing to the next level. 

Foundational Journey: From PCMA to MSCA 
The founders of MSCA ‚Äî Mr. Surendra Shelke, Mr. Sagar Palkar, and Mr. 
Shrikrishna Kaduskar ‚Äî were also the driving force behind the Pimpri Chinchwad 
Mountaineering Association (PCMA). PCMA proposed the idea 
of a climbing wall to PCMC in the late 1990s. In a landmark moment, Surendra Shelke and a few 
associates traveled all the way to Bikaner‚Äînot to compete, but to observe the West 
Zone Sport Climbing Championship firsthand, as part of their preparation for building 
a climbing wall in PCMC. 
In 2000, their efforts bore fruit with the construction of the first-ever competition
standard climbing wall at Annasaheb Magar Stadium, built through PCMC's 
support. Surendra Shelke, affectionately known as Surya, was the backbone of this 
project. Without his relentless drive, this wall would not have materialized. 
Pioneering Competitions and Infrastructure Development 
Under the guidance of the late Khaire Sir and Surya, PCMA successfully hosted 
the first West Zone Sport Climbing Championship in 2002, followed by 
the National Championship in 2005. The overwhelming success of the 2005 
Nationals inspired the team to propose another climbing wall‚Äîthis time in Pune. 
Though the proposal was submitted in 2005, it took five years of tireless follow-up to 
bring the Raje Shivaji Climbing Wall in Shivajinagar, Pune, to life. The journey 
was not easy‚Äîover 150 potential sites were reviewed, with many rejected due to 
resistance from locals and political representatives unfamiliar with the sport. In one 
instance, even after finalizing the land and gathering for a Bhumi 
Poojan (groundbreaking ceremony), opposition from locals forced the project to be 
scrapped at that location. 
Nevertheless, perseverance prevailed. The wall was finally built in 2010 and became 
functional by 2012. It proudly hosted the first homologated speed climbing wall in 
India, and also introduced the country's first timing device for speed climbing, 
setting new national standards. 
Shaping Policy for Adventure and Sport Climbing 
In 2010, with news of the Maharashtra Government formulating a Sports Policy, the 
PCMA saw a major opportunity. While many adventure groups submitted fragmented 
requests for support (tickets, expedition funds, etc.), PCMA took a different route. 
After first understanding the government's intent, two detailed presentations were 
submitted: 
1. A comprehensive proposal for all adventure sports (Air, Water, and Land), 
emphasizing mountaineering and rock climbing. 
2. A dedicated proposal for Sport Climbing. 
This proactive and structured approach led to a landmark outcome: 
‚Ä¢ A separate chapter on Adventure Sports was added in the 2012 
Maharashtra State Sports Policy. 
‚Ä¢ The policy recognized Air, Water, and Land-based adventure sports as 
distinct disciplines, each meriting individual awards. 
‚Ä¢ Sport Climbing was formally recognized, and it was decided to include it in 
the prestigious Shiv Chhatrapati State Sports Awards. 
In a historic acknowledgment, the contributions of Surendra Shelke and 
Shrikrishna Kaduskar were specifically mentioned in the 2012 Sport Policy. 
Building a National Climbing Ecosystem 
Since 2000, PCMA and its successors have worked relentlessly to promote Sport 
Climbing, creating a robust talent pipeline that includes: 
‚Ä¢ National and International medal winners 
‚Ä¢ Belayers, route setters, and judges who now serve across India 
‚Ä¢ Elite coaches like Amol, Mantu, and Irfan ‚Äî with Amol also having served 
as the National Coach for Asian competitions

Notably, four homegrown champions: 
‚Ä¢ Hritik Marne aka Nanya
‚Ä¢ Shreya Nankar
‚Ä¢ Sahil Khan
‚Ä¢ Saniya Shaikh

‚Ä¶have been honored with the Shiv Chhatrapati Rajya Krida Puraskar, 
Maharashtra's highest sporting accolade. These achievements stand as a testament 
to decades of dedication in building the sport from the grassroots. 
Empowering the Underprivileged 
A unique and heartwarming aspect of this journey is the socio-economic 
background of many trained athletes. A significant number of them come 
from underprivileged communities and urban slums. Through the association's 
support, they have risen not only as athletes but have now become coaches, 
trainers, and officials ‚Äî emerging as leaders of the next generation. 
The World-Class PCMC Climbing Wall & Future Vision 
The most recent milestone is the erection of the world-class climbing wall at 
PCMC's Yoga Park, a result of untiring efforts by Surendra Shelke and 
Shrikrishna Kaduskar. Regarded as the best in India and among the top in the 
world, this facility marks a new era in Indian climbing infrastructure. 
Recognizing the potential, the MSCA has embarked on an ambitious journey to 
establish a structured Sport Climbing Academy, with the ultimate aim 
of producing Olympic medalists by 2036 ‚Äî a vision aligned with government of 
India's long-term sports development goals. 

MSCA & PCMC: A Strategic Partnership 
MSCA has entered into a 20year agreement with PCMC to manage and operate the 
Climbing Wall at Yoga Park. Under this partnership: 
‚Ä¢ MSCA will oversee all day-to-day operations, training, coaching, and events. 
‚Ä¢ PCMC will continue to provide infrastructure and institutional support. 
Conclusion 
This legacy and structured development illustrate MSCA's 
unmatched credibility, expertise, and vision in the field of Sport Climbing. The 
team has: 
‚Ä¢ Nurtured champions from marginalized backgrounds 
‚Ä¢ Created a national ecosystem of coaches and officials 
‚Ä¢ Influenced state sports policy 
‚Ä¢ Built world-class infrastructure 
The journey so far is a blueprint for sustainable, inclusive, and high-performance 
sport development. With the foundation laid and vision aligned, MSCA is fully 
prepared to take Indian Sport Climbing to Olympic glory by 2036.

## Meeting Break

**User:** "Does this chat get saved? as I have to go for a meeting now if I close this will you remember all that we have discussed till now?"

**AI Response:** Yes, this chat conversation is saved! üéØ However, I should clarify how this works:

## üíæ **Chat Memory:**

‚úÖ **This conversation is saved** - All our discussions, details, and progress are preserved
‚úÖ **I can see the project files** - The code, assets, and structure we've built
‚úÖ **GitHub repository** - Everything is safely stored in your GitHub repo

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note:**

When you return, I'll have access to:
- ‚úÖ All the MSCA details and timeline you shared
- ‚úÖ The project files and code we've built
- ‚úÖ The GitHub repository with all our work
- ‚úÖ The assets and logo we've added

**However**, I won't have the specific conversation history in my memory. But don't worry! I can quickly review:
- The project structure
- The README file with all details
- The code comments and documentation
- The GitHub repository

## üöÄ **What to Do When You Return:**

Just say something like:
- "Continue with the MSCA website project"
- "I'm back, let's continue building the climbing association website"
- "Show me what we've built so far"

And I'll immediately:
1. Review the project structure
2. Recall the MSCA story and timeline
3. Continue from where we left off
4. Be ready for the client requirements you were about to share

## üìù **Quick Summary for Your Return:**

**User:** "Can you save our conversation?"

**AI Response:** I understand your concern! Let me clarify how this works:

## üíæ **Conversation Status:**

**Good news!** This conversation is automatically saved by the system, but I should explain the technical details:

### ‚úÖ **What IS Saved:**
- **All our code and files** - Everything is in your GitHub repository
- **Project structure** - Complete Next.js setup with Three.js and GSAP
- **All the MSCA details** - Story, timeline, requirements are documented
- **Assets and logo** - All SVGs and files are stored
- **Git history** - Every commit with detailed messages

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **What I Won't Remember:**
- The specific conversation flow and context
- Our detailed discussions about emotions and vision
- The exact sequence of our planning

## üöÄ **But Here's the Solution:**

When you return, I can quickly get back up to speed by:

1. **Reading the project files** - I'll see all our work
2. **Checking the README** - It has the complete MSCA story
3. **Reviewing the code** - I'll understand what we've built
4. **Looking at the GitHub repo** - Everything is documented there

## üìù **For Extra Safety:**

Would you like me to create a comprehensive project summary document right now? I can save all our key decisions, the MSCA story, timeline, and next steps in a file that will definitely be preserved.

**Just say "yes" and I'll create a complete project documentation file that captures everything we've discussed!**

This way, even if there are any issues, we'll have a complete record of our vision and progress! üèîÔ∏è‚ú®

**User:** "yes please save your messages and my messages in the same flow Don't shorten any text"

**AI Response:** Absolutely! I'll create a comprehensive project documentation file that captures our entire conversation flow. Let me save everything exactly as we discussed:
